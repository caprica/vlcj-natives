     * if it arises, is considered a client application validation failure.

     * rely on the file URI starting "file:/" (bad) or "file://" good, so we must account for either case.
     * <p>
     * With JDK 1.7+ we could have used the Path class to get a URI in the proper format.

     * Implementation notes:
     * <p>
     * The main concern is to check if the URI starts "file:/", or "file://", clearly care must be taken with this test,
     * since the leading characters match, so we must base our condition on the longer string.
     * <p>
     * If the URI starts with "file://", we are done at this point and return.
     * <p>
     * If the URI starts with "file:/", as is almost certainly the case when using {@link File#toURI()}, then we apply a
     * replacement by dropping "file:/" and adding "file:///" in its place. When replacing in this manner, a third slash
     * is added to separate the unused "authority" part of the URI (this could in theory have been something like
     * "file://localhost/path/file.ext", so we return it as "file:///path/file.ext" instead).
