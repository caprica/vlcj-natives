/**
 * Encapsulation of access to native strings.
 * <p>
 * This class takes care of freeing the memory that was natively allocated for the string, if needed.
 * <p>
 * Generally, any native API that returns "const char*" must <em>not</em> be freed, so in such cases the native return
 * type mapping can actually be String rather than {@link Pointer}. Alternatively, {@link #copyNativeString(Pointer)}
 * can be used.
 * <p>
 * Generally, Any native API that returns "char*" <em>must</em> be freed, so in such cases the native return type
 * mapping must be {@link Pointer} and {@link #copyAndFreeNativeString(Pointer)} must be used.
 * <p>
 * Where a native string is contained in a {@link com.sun.jna.Structure} those strings should <em>not</em> be freed if
 * the structure itself is subsequently freed (usually by a companion release native method), so in these cases
 * {@link #copyNativeString(Pointer)} must be used.
